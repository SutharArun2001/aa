## Creating GIFs

Embedding an animated gif in your README quickly demonstrates what your project does and catches the reader's eye. Here are a few programs that can help you quickly create gifs for your project:

- [Gifox](https://gifox.app) - **$14.99** - Clean UI, hotkeys, lots of advanced features.
- [Gifski](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Gifski#readme) - **FREE** - More vivid colors than the rest, but still keep size low.
